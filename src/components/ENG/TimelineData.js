    text: "Since I had already started to learn Python during my studies, I first deepened this knowledge with an extensive Udemy course. This was the origin of many small projects, such as the automation of various Excel tables for my work at ASB or a Python tool to query connection information from the API of the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg local transport association. I worked with a wide variety of technologies such as Docker, Nginx, MongoDB and RestAPI until I came across React at the end of 2020. Since then I have put my focus on front-end development and, in addition to other online courses, I am developing websites for friends and acquaintances.",

After the initial enthusiasm, I quickly realized that the topics and their treatment were very theoretical and that I missed the immediate tinkering on a real project. Due to the corona pandemic and the social aspect of the course that was also omitted as a result, I decided to quit and take my education into my own hands.",

At the beginning of my job I worked almost exclusively in data acquisition, but I was quickly able to take on more responsibility. My activities then included the quality check of the recorded data as well as the permanent further development of the data model, the GUI, queries and reports. Furthermore, I made adjustments to the WebGIS for the plan information and trained the Netcom network information team.",
